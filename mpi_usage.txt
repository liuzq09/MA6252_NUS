The workstations are located at Centre for Computational Science and Engineering. Blk S16, level 8, CCSE lab.

Please see http://web.cse.nus.edu.sg/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page for more information. (Osprey workstations)

Here, in very short form how you can use a machine:

1) Connect to one of those computers by e.g.
ssh myuserid@hawk1.cse.nus.edu.sg

or get access to the computer directly.

2) Get your program to the computer (here hello.cc) either by scp or program remotely via e.g. vi

3) Compile the program:
mpic++ -o hello hello.cc

4) Execute the program (here using 4 processes):
mpirun -np 4 ./hello


To execute the program interactively is only accepted for very short run-times (up to a few seconds). 
In case you have a program that takes longer than that, you have to use the scheduling system (according to the policies). 
Please see the website for more information and how to use it. However, the programs of our tasks should all run less than a few seconds.
